I'm currently heading India operations for Plate IQ. I also consult/advise companies on building great, functional software teams. When not consulting or helping out friends with tech/processes, I'm busy reading up on psychology, business, and getting shit done.

Previous experience includes working at Pricebaba (Mumbai, India), Microsoft (Redmond and India). Worked (to varying extents) on large-scale web services infrastructure, automation infrastructure, telemetry, monitoring and alerting, deployment tech, crawling, etc. I find playing around with data fascinating, and have a keen interest in intelligent systems - and would love to work on those. Very interested in software design/architecture.

Other than tech - I like arts (admiring the aesthetic, fancy stuff), meeting people, travel, adventure sports and trying out new stuff. And have a particularly strong interest in subjects related to social evolution - religion, war, history, spirituality, justice/morality and philosophy about work and happiness and life. And I totally love [Calvin and Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes).
