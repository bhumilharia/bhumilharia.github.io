Quick 60 second intro - I build software products for a living. An engineer by training, I've spent
most of the last decade building software systems with varying degrees of scale and automation (across
industries, company sizes, tech stacks). More recently, my focus has moved to building and enabling
strong, productive engineering teams and tech businesses.

I'm currently heading India operations for

**Consulting**:
Apart from my day job, I spend time helping founders/companies/teams maximize their software
engineering productivity. Examples of this include helping non-technical founders on bootstrapping
software development for their new start-up idea, assisting in building and hiring remote teams,
or for companies looking to establish India development centers, helping them out with
admin/team building operations. Anything related to (software + teams + productivity),
really.

If any of these are sound like topics that interest you (or problems you have), let's talk! Building
the Plate IQ team from zero (still growing) has been a rewarding experience, and I'd love to help you
in any way I can! You can get in touch with me at bhumil@bhumilharia.com.


**Previous Work**:
I started my career in software at Microsoft Redmond, writing code for shared client services for
Microsoft Office. After moving back to India, I've spent the last few years working with a host
of Indian product startups - including Pricebaba, *Paycraft Solutions*.

Have basically worked (to varying extents) on large-scale web services infrastructure, automation
infrastructure, telemetry, monitoring and alerting, deployment tech, crawling, transit and ticketing
systems, enterprise integrations, open source, developer tooling, etc.


**Other**:
Other than tech - I like arts (admiring the aesthetic, fancy stuff), meeting people, travel, adventure
ports and trying out new things. And have a particularly strong interest in subjects related to social
evolution - religion, war, history, spirituality, justice/morality and philosophy about work and
happiness and life. 

And I totally love
