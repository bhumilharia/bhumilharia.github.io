        <article>
            <p>This one&rsquo;s inspired from the TFI seminar arranged by Technovanza some time back. Not much relation
between that and the topic, really; apart from one statement that was made there (one of the most
abused statements, mind you) &ldquo;&hellip;to not be a part of the &lsquo;rat race&rsquo;&hellip;&rdquo;. Nothing wrong with that.
Except that it is among the over-abused and cliched statements existing. Other variants are &lsquo;dont
follow the herd&rsquo; or worse, &lsquo;think outside the box&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So what <em>is</em> this rat-race everyone keeps talking about? The one where everyone&rsquo;s in a mad rush to
get marks, get a good college, get a good job and eventually get a lot of money? Perhaps. Perhaps not.
Either ways, is it the only one existent? Seems that way, doesn&rsquo;t it? Not really. Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;</p>
<p>The first example would be the one I wrote about above. The speaker from TFI said something to the
effect of &lsquo;you join TFI, not be a part of the mad rush, be different, be a leader&rsquo;. What then, someone
asked. What after TFI? Fair question, you&rsquo;d agree. So then we were shown told about how TFI fellows
joined various different streams, or how TFI had connections with universities and companies, etc
that would help your career. There, aren&rsquo;t you back in the race again?</p>
<p>Another prominent example is the way the current young mindset seems to be shifting- with jobs seeming
&lsquo;boring&rsquo; (even without people having worked in a corporate to back that claim), startups seeming &lsquo;cool&rsquo;,
and so  for other similar options. I&rsquo;ll be honest, I&rsquo;ve myself had a similar outlook for far too long to
deny it - without any reason to back it. Let&rsquo;s assume, for the sake of argument, that the claim is true.
Even then, what happens when you start up and it becomes successful? You work harder - to compete with
other firms, to expand explosively, to grow, to get filthy rich - whichever. Sounds like a race to me.
(and I must mention that dropping out to do this seems to be another fancy thing these days)</p>
<p>I can think of a couple of similar examples of dont-follow-the-herd mentality. For heaven&rsquo;s sake, the
idea trying to be conveyed is to <em>do what YOU feel like doing</em>. And that is NOT the same as leaving
the main herd to follow another one. And &lsquo;thinking out of the box&rsquo; is not the same as &lsquo;ignoring box
contents no matter how good they are&rsquo;.</p>
<p>All I have come to realize is that no definition of the phrase &lsquo;rat race&rsquo; can be used everywhere.
Perhaps a rule of thumb would be to classify everything that you like doing as not-rat-race, and
everything that you do out of compulsion as otherwise.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>PS: All of this hasn&rsquo;t come from a third-person perspective. It all stems from the fact that I held
a similar opinion (misconception, if you will) for long, and it has taken ridiculous amounts of
thinking/researching about what I wanted to do after B. Tech. to decide. Bless the people who helped
me with focus and direction.</p>
